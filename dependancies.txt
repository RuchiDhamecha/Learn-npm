dependancies

when u install any package it can have dependancies
means 
my project have dependancy of cowsay package 
but cowsay also have dependancy means it also depends on few packages

this all info of dependancies is saved in package-lock.json file 


so when u have to insatll ur project on other device ,
just run a command

npm install
    or
npm i


so it will automatically install all the packages with exact version in which the projct has build.
