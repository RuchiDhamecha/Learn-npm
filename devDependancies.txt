these are the dependancies that are require to build the project to develope the project .

so at the time of production,
we dont need it neither user need such packages to run the application.

so such packages are stored in devDependancies

to install only not devDependancies packages

    NODE_ENV="production" npm install

    or

    NODE_ENV="production" npm i
