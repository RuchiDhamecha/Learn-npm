npm sripts

"scripts":{
    "test":"echo \"Eroor\" && exit 1"
}

scripts is a object so it holds key value pair

##

"scripts":{
    "test":"echo \"Eroor\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node index.js"
}
in terminal to run just hit command
    npm start

##

"scripts":{
    "test":"echo \"Eroor\" && exit 1",
    "exec": "node index.js"
}
in terminal to run just hit command
    npm run exec 

so the script which not already hardcoded in npm sript the key words so u have to write "run" afetr "npm"

 this can be used when u have run same large command again n again , scripts can be used.
