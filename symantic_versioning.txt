# symantic versioning in npm packages

in any version ,
    ex, 12.4.2
it is

    major minor patch


major version when u make incompatible API changes
minor when u add functionality
patch when bcakward compatible bug fixes
===========================================================

In versioning,

 ^ (caret symbol)
 ex. ^12.2.3  === 12.x.x
 means 
  this allows patch and minor updates for versions and patch updates for versions..
  so if again wants to install it will keep major version same but if new minor and patch version can be updated

    

~ (tilde symbol)
ex. ~12.2.3
means 
    Allows patch-level changes if a minor version is specified on the comparator. Allows minor-level changes if not.


if,  3.4.1
in this case it will install exact version.



=========================================================

package-lock.json

saves the exact version and its dependancies with exact version for each module
so even if verion of module changes 
new develeoper will download the same version through npm 
so that issues related to version change wil not occur.
